# Array Methods Additional Practice

After forking and cloning this repo, cd into the repo folder, then type `ls` in the terminal to see each method's directory. While in each directory, the tests for each set of activities should run independent from each other, so long as you run the `npm test` command from that path. From here, you can cd into any method's folder and run the usual:

1. `npm install`
2. `gsw -c branchname`
3. `code .`
4. `npm test`
